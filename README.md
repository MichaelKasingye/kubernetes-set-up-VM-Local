# KUBERNETES SET UP TUTORIAL

Kubernetes Use context, ngnix-ingreress, cert manager on Ubuntu VM
Install docker desktop on your local machine.

``https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/ubuntu/``

It comes along with kubernetes. Enable Kubernetes after installation.

Install Micro K8s on your VM

``https://microk8s.io/docs/getting-started``

Set up kubernetes context so that your local machine can have access to the remote VMâ€™s Kubernetes cluster.

## CONTEXTS <br/>
It essentially defines the execution environment for your Kubernetes operations. 

Utilise;

```bash
kubectl config view --raw
```

The kubectl config view --raw command outputs the raw Kubernetes configuration as it is stored on your system. This includes information about clusters, contexts, users, and other settings that kubectl uses to interact with Kubernetes clusters.

you will get somethihg like this;
```yaml 
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <base64-encoded-cert-data>
    server: https://cluster-api.example.com
  name: my-cluster
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: my-cluster
    user: my-user
  name: my-context
current-context: my-context
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: my-user
  user:
    client-certificate-data: <base64-encoded-client-cert-data>
    client-key-data: <base64-encoded-client-key-data>
```

Edit the above respectively to your context in your local contex.

##### Note
Remember to edit this;

```yaml
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <base64-encoded-cert-data>
    server: https://cluster-api.example.com
  name: my-cluster
```
to:

`` server: https://102.218.90.89:16443 `` change to the server IP of the VM howewver digital Ocean has its own IP it uses.

```yaml
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <base64-encoded-cert-data>
    server: https://102.218.90.60:16443
  name: my-cluster
```

View the contexts:
```bash
kubectl config get-contexts
```

you get:
```
CURRENT   NAME                              CLUSTER                                      AUTHINFO                                           NAMESPACE
*          docker-desktop                    docker-desktop                               docker-desktop                                     
           my-user                           microk8s-cluster                             admin                                              
```

switch context to have access to the VM ``my-user`` kubernetes:
```bash
kubectl config use-context my-user
```
you get:<br/>
``Switched to context "my-user".``

now check the current context you are in;
```bash
kubectl config current-context
```
you get:<br/>
``my-user``

OK, given that we are done with that. Let's set up a load balancer solution using metallb.

## METALLB

### NOTE
When deploying on DigitalOcean you will not need METALLB site it has a loadbalancing solution. 

MetalLB (Metal Load Balancer) is an open-source, software-based load balancer designed to work with Kubernetes. Kubernetes is a popular container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. While Kubernetes provides many features for managing containers, it doesn't include an integrated solution for load balancing external traffic to services within the cluster.

MetalLB fills this gap by enabling a network load balancer for Kubernetes clusters that can distribute incoming traffic to services running within the cluster. It allows you to expose services externally using standard IP protocols, such as TCP and UDP.

https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/

#### Installation by manifest
To install MetalLB, apply the manifest:

```bash
kubectl apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metallb/metallb/v0.13.12/config/manifests/metallb-native.yaml
```
Create a layer 2 yaml confifugration like this;

For example, the following configuration gives MetalLB control over IPs from 192.168.1.240 to 192.168.1.250, and configures Layer 2 mode:

```bash
apiVersion: metallb.io/v1beta1
kind: IPAddressPool
metadata:
  name: first-pool
  namespace: metallb-system
spec:
  addresses:
  - 142.93.222.42-142.93.222.47
```

use this to see the IP ranges for your cluster:
```bash
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```
you get;

```
NAME                   STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION   INTERNAL-IP   EXTERNAL-IP     OS-IMAGE                         KERNEL-VERSION   CONTAINER-RUNTIME
my-user                Ready    <none>   42d   v1.28.2   10.122.0.2    142.93.222.42   Debian GNU/Linux 12 (bookworm)   6.1.0-12-amd64   containerd://1.6.22
```
 Yours could be different. And will use the external IP.

## ADD A PROJECT RESOURCE
create a folder called quote and in it create a yaml file called ``deployment.yaml`` 

```bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  labels:
    name: quote-backend
  name: quote-backend
  namespace: develop
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: quote-backend
  strategy:
    rollingUpdate:
      maxSurge: 25%
      maxUnavailable: 25%
    type: RollingUpdate
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: quote-backend
    spec:
      containers:
        - image: docker.io/datawire/quote:0.4.1
          imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
          name: quote-backend
          resources:
            requests:
              cpu: 50m
              memory: 256Mi
          env:
            - name: NODE_ENV
              value: development
            - name: PORT
              value: '9000'
      imagePullSecrets:
        - name: pullsecret
      restartPolicy: Always


apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: quote-backend
  labels:
    service: quote-backend
  namespace: develop
spec:
  selector:
    app: quote-backend
  type: NodePort
  ports:
    - name: http
      protocol: TCP
      port: 9000
      targetPort: 9000
      nodePort: 30030
    - name: https
      protocol: TCP
      port: 9005
      targetPort: 9005
      nodePort: 30031


```

Create the develop namespace:
```bash
kubectl create ns develop
```

Apply the resource like this
```bash
kubectl apply -f quote/deployment.yaml
```
Check if everything is running;

```bash
kubectl -n develop get all
```

you will see something like this;
However yours may show more information like services running in that name space;

```bash
NAME                   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   AGE
deployment.apps/quote  1/1       1            1           2d12h

NAME                     DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   AGE
replicaset.apps/quote-6c8f564ff   1         1         1       2d12h
```
